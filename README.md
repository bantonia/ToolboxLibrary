 RiscOS DDE C++ Toolbox Library<br>
 Needs o.wimplib from the tboxlibs, otherwise just link applications with o.c++lib and o.stubs.<br>
There are probably lots of things which can be changed so if you have any ideas of improvements/changes, please pass on your thoughts.
I know the DDE C++ compiler is based on CFront and therefore has lots of limitations but I wanted to use the tools at hand.
