The Application !CodeTemplate sources have been generated by !Prototype which can be found in the Tools directory within this Repository.

!Prototype is at a very early stage and uses the ToolboxC++Lib, currently it only generates main and other supporting sources to extend the class ToolboxTask.

!EventExample uses a interface to generate events to update two display fields. The events are registered with the ToolTime module which in turn generates the Toolbox events in the same manner as Toolbox_RaiseToolboxEvent, but does not use Toolbox_RaiseToolboxEvent.
ToolTime hooks into TickerV and the handler creates a callback if there is anything to be processed.
Using !Usage there appears to be very little impact on the efficiency of processing mulltiple applications, Wimp_PollIdle events indicated by !Usage show 100%, still whilst the events are updating the two display fields.
Issues:
High frequency event configurations on soak testing will generate an 'Unknown operand' error.
