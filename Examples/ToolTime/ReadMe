ToolTime, if that is the name it will end as, is a module which dispatches regular Toolbox user events on a timer measured in centiseconds.
It hooks a handler into TickerV, from which a callback is generated if a Toolbox event has been registered.
The callback updates countdowns for any registered Toolbox events, any which reach 0 will trigger a Toolbox event message to the application which registered the event.
Multiple events can be registered from multiple applications. Each Toolbox event registration has its own delay timer and can be different from others, even from within the same application.
There is no requirement for Wimp_PollIdle handling, but can be implemented if there is a need for other purposes.
