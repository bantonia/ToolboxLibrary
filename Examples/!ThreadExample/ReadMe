The standard RISCOS currently runs on a single processor, this module does not achieve multi-threading for RISCOS, but it does allow Toolbox
applications to call Toolbox user events via a timer as single threads giving the illusion of multiple processes taking place.

Long running processes could use this facility to slice their processing into smaller chunks, loading and saving their state
upon entry and exit until completion. 

ToDo
Rewrite the module in C
Pass parameters to the module on load to change the default number of data blocks and how frequently the Toolbox events are generated by changing the delay of the OS_CallEvery
